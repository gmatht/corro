//! Pure, I/O-free model for the headless `zork` backend.
//!
//! Everything here is plain data + operations on it: no terminal access, no
//! `rustyline`, and no `thread_local` global required. A [`ZorkState`] is just a
//! value you can own, clone, snapshot to JSON, and drive from either the
//! interactive REPL ([`crate::backends::zork::repl`]) or the typed test harness
//! ([`crate::backends::zork::harness`]).
//!
//! The free functions that the per-widget adapters call (e.g.
//! [`crate::backends::zork::facade::create_button`], `set_label_text`) operate on
//! a thread-local singleton so that the existing `backends_zork_adapter` shim
//! keeps working unchanged. That singleton is a thin wrapper over a `ZorkState`;
//! tests that want a clean, isolated instance should use [`ZorkState`] /
//! [`harness::Harness`] directly instead.
//!
//! # Model shape
//!
//! A node is *kind* + *properties*:
//!
//! * [`ZorkKind`] holds the type-specific data (a label's text, a grid's cell
//!   list, a menu's items).
//! * [`ZorkProps`] holds everything that applies to *every* widget regardless of
//!   type — geometry, visibility, expansion, margins, CSS classes, alignment,
//!   font, scroll, and the pointer/key callback lists. Keeping it in one
//!   serializable struct is what lets [`ZorkState::snapshot`] report the whole
//!   model and lets tests diff a property change without caring which widget it
//!   came from.

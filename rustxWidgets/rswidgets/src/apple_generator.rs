//! Generate the Objective-C *forwarding shims* the Apple backends send
//! messages to, so the Rust side and the ObjC side cannot drift.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! Both Apple backends reach the framework through the Objective-C runtime and
//! therefore need a handful of classes that live **in the host app bundle**:
//! a target/action trampoline, a text measurer/drawer, an alert wrapper, and a
//! canvas view. Most of them are *pure forwarding* — the Rust side already
//! knows the exact selector and its signature (it names them in its `raw_send!`
//! calls), and the ObjC side only has to declare the same method and hand the
//! arguments to a `corro_*` C function or to the framework.
//!
//! Hand-writing those files means two independent declarations of one ABI.
//! A `.m` file that drifts from the Rust signature does not fail to compile —
//! it crashes at runtime with a mismatched `objc_msgSend` (the classic arm64
//! register-file corruption `IOS_GUIDELINES.md` warns about). That is exactly
//! the failure this generator removes: the signatures below are the contract,
//! and the emitted `.m` is derived from it.
//!
//! ## What it does and does not generate
//!
//! **Generated** (pure boilerplate, no design content):
//!   * `Corro<Platform>Target`  — callback-id → `corro_<platform>_callback`
//!   * `Corro<Platform>Alert`   — `corroNewAlert`/`corroAddAction:`/`corroSetTitle:`
//!     over `UIAlertController`+`UIAlertView` (iOS) or `NSAlert` (macOS)
//!   * category extras on the base view class the adapters call
//!     (`corroSetSpacing:`, `corroSetFlex:`, `corroSetMinWidth:`,
//!     `corroSetCanvasId:`, the `corroBoundsWidth/Height` accessors)
//!
//! **Deliberately not generated** (see [`CanvasView`]):
//!   * the canvas view class itself. Its body is *behaviour*, not forwarding —
//!     `drawRect:` reporting the laid-out size before replaying the closure,
//!     touch/mouse coordinate conversion, `pressesBegan:`/`keyDown:` for a
//!     hardware keyboard, the `isFlipped` override, and the documented
//!     degradation paths found by CI (an older SDK without a selector). Those
//!     are the lines a human reads when the sheet does not draw.
//!   * `Corro<Platform>Text`. Its `measure:`/`drawText:` bodies are the
//!     version table (`boundingRectWithSize:` on iOS 7+ vs `sizeWithFont:` on
//!     iOS 6; `UIFont`/`NSFont` resolution). The selector *signatures* are
//!     listed below so the file can be checked against them, but the bodies
//!     stay hand-written: a generator cannot validate them without an SDK, and
//!     a wrong body there is a layout bug rather than a crash.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! Same pattern as [`crate::android_generator`]: a host's `build.rs` includes
//! this file with `#[path]` (so a vendored rswidgets still works and there is
//! no `[build-dependencies]` entry), then:
//!
//! ```text
//! println!("cargo:rerun-if-env-changed={}", rswidgets_shims::PROJECT_ENV);
//! rswidgets_shims::run();
//! ```
//!
//! Opt-in via the environment variable, additive (existing files are never
//! overwritten), and never fails a build — a read-only or absent Apple project
//! must not break a desktop build of the same crate.
